// In large Projects we create a separate folder named components and put all the components in that folder.
// This is done to keep the project structure clean and organized.
// This file is used to export all the components from the components folder.
// This way we can import all the components from a single file instead of importing them individually from their respective files.

import InputBox from "./Inputbox";
